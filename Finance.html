          <p class="my-3 head" style="font-size:1.5rem;"> Finance is the process of channeling funds in the form of
            credit, loans, or invested
            capital to those economic entities that most need them or can put them to the most productive use. The
            institutions that channel funds from savers to users are called financial intermediaries. They include
            commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations, and such nonbank institutions as credit
            unions, insurance companies, pension funds, investment companies, and finance companies.
            Three broad areas in finance have developed specialized institutions, procedures, standards, and goals:
            business finance, personal finance, and public finance. </p>

        Home Finance </h2><br>
      <p style="font-size:x-large">Home finance refers to the process of obtaining funding for the purchase of a home or
        other residential property. The most common form of home finance is a mortgage, which is a loan that is secured
        by the property being purchased. In a mortgage, the borrower (homebuyer) typically provides a down payment, and
        the lender (such as a bank or other financial institution) provides the remaining amount needed to purchase the
        property.The borrower then agrees to repay the loan over a specified period of time, which is typically 15 to 30
        years, through a series of monthly payments. The lender charges interest on the loan, which is the cost of
        borrowing the money.The specific terms of a home finance arrangement can vary depending on a number of factors,
        including the borrower's credit score, the value of the property being purchased, and the type of mortgage
        product chosen. Some mortgages have fixed interest rates, meaning the interest rate remains the same throughout
        the life of the loan, while others have adjustable interest rates, which can change over time.In addition to
        traditional mortgages, there are also other forms of home finance available, such as government-backed loans
        like FHA and VA loans, and alternative financing options like seller financing and lease-to-own agreements.
        Overall, home finance is an essential part of the homebuying process and requires careful consideration to
        ensure that borrowers are able to obtain the funding they need to purchase a home that meets their needs and
        budget.

        SME (Small & Medium-Sized Enterprises) </h2> <br>
      <p style="font-size:x-large">Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are businesses that typically have fewer
        employees and generate less revenue than larger corporations. The specific definition of what constitutes an SME
        varies by country and industry. Each country
        has its own definition of what constitutes a small and medium-sized enterprise. Certain size criteria must
        be met and occasionally the industry in which the company operates in is taken into account as well.Small
        and mid-size enterprises can exist in almost any industry, but it is more likely they reside within
        industries requiring fewer employees and requiring smaller upfront capital investments. Common types of
        SMEs include legal firms, dentist offices, restaurants, or bars.SMEs are segregated from large,
        multi-national companies because they fundamentally operate differently. Large, complex firms may require
        advanced ERP systems, interconnectivity across offices around the world, or must deeper organizational
        charges.SMEs play a critical role in the economy, as they often drive innovation and provide employment
        opportunities in local communities. Many governments offer various forms of support for SMEs, including tax
        incentives, loans, and grants, in order to help them grow and thrive. </p>

        Mortgage </h2><br>
      <p style="font-size:x-large">A mortgage is a type of loan that is used to purchase or refinance a property. In a
        mortgage, a lender provides a borrower with a specific amount of money to purchase a property, and the borrower
        agrees to pay back the loan over a set period of time, typically with interest.The property that is being
        purchased serves as collateral for the loan, meaning that if the borrower is unable to make their payments, the
        lender may take possession of the property in order to recoup their losses.Mortgages typically have a fixed or
        variable interest rate, and the length of the loan (known as the term) can vary depending on the lender and the
        borrower's preferences. In most cases, mortgages are paid back in monthly installments over a period of 15 to 30
        years, although some mortgages may have shorter or longer terms.So mortgages are an important tool for
        individuals
        and families looking to purchase a home or invest in property. However, it's important to carefully consider the
        terms of a mortgage before signing on, as they can have a significant impact on your long-term financial
        situation.

        Loan on Property </h2><br>
      <p style="font-size:x-large">Loan against property is a secured loan
        availed of against a commercial or residential porperty kept as collateral with the lender. As the funds
        come with no end-use restriction , borrowers can utilise the funds for various purposes, such as to fund a
        business expansionm or your child's wedding or education.One of the important things you must know about
        LAP is that the lenders provide only a certain percentage of the market value of the property. The banks
        usually lend about 50% to 60% of the property. Other private lenders give about 80% of the property value.
        Since you keep collateral with the lender, LAP is a secured loan.Taking out a loan on a property can be a viable
        option for individuals who want to purchase a home or other real estate property but lack the financial means to
        do so upfront. However, it is important to carefully consider the financial implications of taking on a mortgage
        loan, including the total cost of the loan, the interest rate, and the monthly payment. Borrowers should also
        ensure that they have a stable source of income and are able to make the required payments over the life of the
        loan.</p>
