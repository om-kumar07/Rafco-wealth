      Life Insurance<br>
      <p style="font-size:x-large">Life insurance is a contract between the policyholder and an
        insurance company, where the insurance company agrees to pay a designated amount of money to the policyholder's
        beneficiaries upon the policyholder's death. The policyholder agrees to pay a premium, which is a regular
        payment to the insurance company in exchange for coverage.
        The amount of the payout to the beneficiaries is determined by the policyholder at the time of application, and
        can be used to help cover the expenses associated with the policyholder's death, such as funeral expenses or
        outstanding debts. The beneficiaries are named by the policyholder and can include family members, friends, or
        charitable organizations.</p>

        their loved ones will be financially
        supported in the event of their death. It can also be used as a tool for estate planning or to provide for a

      Health Insurance <br>
      <p style="font-size:x-large">The current COVID-19 pandemic has made the entire world sit up and realise that
        medical emergencies are unpredictable and can cause a financial upheaval that is tough to handle.Lifestyle
        diseases are on the rise, especially among people under the age of 45. Illnesses like diabetes, obesity,
        respiratory problems, heart disease, all of which are prevalent among the older generation, are now rampant
        in younger people too.As medical technology improves and diseases increase, the cost for treatment rises as
        well. And it is important to understand that medical expenses are not limited to only hospitals. The costs
        for doctor's consultation, diagnosis tests, ambulance charges, operation theatre costs, medicines, room
        rent, etc. are also continually increasing. All of these could put a considerable strain on your finances if
        you are not adequately prepared.When an individual has health insurance, they are typically required to pay a
        monthly premium, which is a fixed amount of money paid to the insurance company to maintain coverage. The
        insurance company then agrees to pay a portion of the costs associated with medical care, based on the terms of
        the policy. <a href="health_insurance.html">Know more..</a> </p>

      Moter Insurance<br>
      <p style="font-size:x-large">Car owners are advised to purchase motor insurance before they even take their car
        onto
        the road. Yet, many consider motor insurance an unnecessary expense. They assume that because they have never
        filed a claim in the past, the need will not arise in the future. You never know when your luck might run out.
        Insurance was never about the best-case scenario. Just as life insurance pays out on someone's death, motor
        insurance becomes significant following an accident, theft, or general damage to your vehicle.An unfortunate car
        accident could push the at-fault driver into bankruptcy, particularly if he/she is uninsured or underinsured. If
        your mistakes behind the wheel send a carload of passengers to the hospital, you would be liable to pay their
        medical expenses. Assuming there were no injuries, you would still need to pay for the damage to the other car.
        To top it all, if somebody slams you with a lawsuit, you would have to foot the legal bills as well.</p>
